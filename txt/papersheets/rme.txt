These are the demlinks paper sheets which I used irl as I was brainstorming through time

*.JPG = exported with gimp (to clean exif and any/all metadata) but image unmodified(kinda, since it's jpeg => re-econded on export) 
  - well exif didn't get cleaned! so I used:
  exiv2 -da rm filenamehere.JPG
  which gives this:

Error: XMP Toolkit error 203: Duplicate property or field node
Warning: Failed to decode XMP metadata.

----
*.jpg = exported(no exif due to copy/paste in new window) with contents modified(eg. cropped)
----


All jpg (case insensitive) were tested for consistency using jpeginfo (in gentoo), this command:
find . -type f -iname '*.jpg' -exec jpeginfo -c {} \; | grep -E "WARNING|ERROR"
(manually retyped here, due to missing copy/paste functionality atm - virtualbox)
